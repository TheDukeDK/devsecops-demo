# TFE Automation Script
Script to automate interactions with Terraform Enterprise, including the cloning of a repository containing Terraform configuration code, creation of a workspace, tarring and uploading of the Terraform code, setting of variables, triggering a run, checking Sentinel policies, and finally doing an apply if permitted. If an apply is done, the script waits for it to finish and then downloads the apply log and the before and after state files. If an apply cannot be done, it downloads the plan log instead.

There is also a script to delete the workspace.

## Introduction
This script uses curl to interact with Terraform Enterprise via the Terraform Enterprise REST API. The same APIs could be used from Jenkins or other solutions to incorporate Terraform Enterprise into your CI/CD pipeline.

Three arguments can be provided on the command line when calling the script:
1. The first, **git_url**, is an optional URL for a git repository from which the script should clone some Terraform code.
1. The second, **workspace**, is the name of the workspace to use or create if it does not already exist. Note that TFE workspace names are not allowed to contain spaces. The script checks for this and will exit if workspace contains any spaces.
1. The third, **override**, is used in two ways:
    1. to automatically do an apply when no Sentinel policies exist or none of them are applicable to the workspace.
    1. to override any soft-mandatory Sentinel policies that failed.

If you only want to set override to "yes" without passing values for the first two arguments, please use `./loadAndRunWorkspace.sh "" "" yes` to run the script.

The script uses several json templates which are written out to the file system and then deleted.

The script does the following steps:
1. Clones a git repository containing Terraform configuration code or uses the code in the config directory if no git URL was provided.
1. Packages the Terraform code into a tar file.
1. Creates the workspace if it does not already exist.
1. Creates a new configuration version.
1. Uploads the tar file as a new configuration.
1. Adds Terraform and environment variables from the file variables.csv that was included in the cloned repository if it exists or from the local copy in the same directory as the script. That local version adds one Terraform variable called "name" with value "Roger" and one Environment variable called "TF_CLI_ARGS" with value "-no-color" to the workspace. This supresses color codes from the apply log output. You can edit this file to add as many variables as you want and then add it to your repository.
1. Determines the number of Sentinel policies so that it knows whether it needs to check them.
1. Starts a new run.
1. Enters a loop to check the run results periodically.
    - If $run_status is "planned", $is_confirmable is "True", and $override is "no", the script stops. In this case, no Sentinel policies existed or none of them were applicable to this workspace. The script will stop.  The user should can apply the run in the Terraform Enterprise UI.
    - If $run_status is "planned", $is_confirmable is "True", and $override is "yes", the script will do an apply. As in the previous case, no Sentinel policies existed or none of them were applicable to this workspace.
    - If $run_status is "policy_checked", it does an Apply. In this case, all Sentinel policies passed.
    - If $run_status is "policy_override" and $override is "yes", it overrides the failed policy checks and does an Apply. In this case, one or more Sentinel policies failed, but they were marked "advisory" or "soft-mandatory" and the script was configured to override the failure.
    - If $run_status is "policy_override" and $override is "no", it prints out a message indicating that some policies failed and are not being overridden.
    - If $run_status is "errored", either the plan failed or a Sentinel policy marked "hard-mandatory" failed. The script terminates.
    - If $run_status is "planned_and_finished", the plan had no changes to apply. The script terminates.
    - If $run_status is "canceled", a user canceled the run. The script terminates.
    - If $run_status is "force_canceled", a user forcefully canceled the run. The script terminates.
    - If $run_status is "discarded", a user discarded the run. The script terminates.
    - Other values of $run_status cause the loop to repeat after a brief sleep.
1. If $save_plan was set to "true" in the above loop, the script outputs and saves the plan log.
1. If any apply was done, the script goes into a second loop to wait for the apply to finish, error, or be canceled.
1. If and when the apply finishes, the script downloads the apply log and the state files from before and after the apply.

In addition to the loadAndRunWorkspace.sh script, this example includes the following files:

1. [config/main.tf](./config/main.tf) which is a file with some Terraform code that says "Hello" to the person whose name is given and generates a random number. This is used if no git URL is provided to the script.
1. [variables.csv](./variables.csv) which contains the variables that are uploaded to the workspace if no file with the same name is found in the root directory of the cloned repository. The columns are key, value, category, hcl, and sensitive with the last two corresponding to the hcl and sensitive checkboxes of TFE variables. This should be in the same directory as the script unless you include a file with the same name in your git repository.
1. [deleteWorkspace.sh](./deleteWorkspace.sh): a script that can be used to delete the workspace.
1. [restrict-name-variable.sentinel](./restrict-name-variable.sentinel): a Sentinel policy you can add to your TFE organization in order to see how the script can check Sentinel policies and even override soft-mandatory failures.

The following files are embedded inside the script:

1. **workspace.template.json** which is used to generate _workspace.json_ which is used when creating the workspace. If you wish to add or modify the settings that are included in the _@workspace.json_ payload, add them to _workspace.template.json_ inside the script and be sure to check the Terraform Enterprise API [syntax](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/api/workspaces.html#update-a-workspace). Update or modify `"terraform-version": "0.11.14"` within _workspace.template.json_  to set a specific workspace version of the Terraform OSS binary.
1. **configversion.json** which is used to generate a new configuration version.
1. **variable.template.json** which is used to generate _variable.json_ which is used when creating a variable called "name" in the workspace.
1. **run.template.json** which is used to generate _run.json_ which is used when triggering a run against the workspace.
1. **apply.json** which is used when doing the apply against the workspace.

## Preparation
Do the following before using this script:

1. `git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-guides.git`
1. `cd operations/automation-script`
1. Make sure [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed on your machine and in your path since the script uses python to parse JSON documents returned by the Terraform Enterprise REST API.
1. If you want the script to use a variables.csv file stored in the git repository containing your Terraform code, edit the sample file with that name and add it to the root of your repository.
1. To see how the script can check Sentinel policies and even override soft-mandatory failures, add the included restrict-name-variable.sentinel policy to your TFE organization. See the [Managing Sentinel Policies](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/sentinel/manage-policies.html) documentation for instructions.

## Using with Private Terraform Enteprise Server using private CA
If you use this script with a Private Terraform Enterprise (PTFE) server that uses a private CA instead of a public CA, you will need to ensure that the curl commands run by the script will trust the private CA.  There are several ways to do this.  The first is easiest for enabling the automation script to run, but it only affects curl. The second and third are useful for using the Terraform and TFE CLIs against your PTFE server. The third is a permanent solution.
1. `export  CURL_CA_BUNDLE=<path_to_ca_bundle>`
1. Export the Golang SSL_CERT_FILE and/or SSL_CERT_DIR environment variables. For instance, you could set the first of these to the same CA bundle used in option 1.
1. Copy your certificate bundle to /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors and then run `update-ca-trust extract`.

## Instructions
Follow these instructions to run the script with with the included main.tf and variables.csv files or with your own git repository:

1. Generate a [team token](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/service-accounts.html#team-service-accounts) for the owners team in your organization in the Terraform Enterprise UI by selecting your organization settings, then Teams, then owners, and then clicking the Generate button and saving the token that is displayed.
1. `export TFE_TOKEN=<owners_token>` where \<owners_token\> is the token generated in the previous step.
1. `export TFE_ORG=<your_organization>` where \<your_organization\> is the name of your target TFE organization.
1. `export TFE_ADDR=<your_address>` where \<your_address\> is the custom address of your target TFE server in the format server.domain.tld. If you do not set this environment variable it will default to the Terraform Enterprise Cloud/SaaS address of app.terraform.io.
1. If you want, edit _loadAndRunWorkspace.sh_ to change the name of the workspace that will be created by editing the workspace variable. *Note* that you can also pass the workspace as the second argument to the script.
1. If you want, you can change the sleep_duration variable which controls how often the script checks the status of the triggered run (in seconds). Setting a longer value would make sense if using Terraform code that takes longer to apply.
1. If you are providing a URL to clone a git repository, you can add Terraform and environment variables needed by your Terraform code to [variables.csv](./variables.csv) and remove the "name" variable. You can also add the edited variables.csv file to your repository.
1. If you want to use the sample main.tf or other code you place in the config directory, run  `./loadAndRunWorkspace.sh` or `./loadAndRunWorkspace.sh "" "" <override>` where \<override\> is "yes" or "no". (The empty quotes are needed in the second case so that override is the third variable.) If you do not specify a value for \<override\>, the script will set it to "no".
1. If you want the script to clone some Terraform code from a git repository, run `./loadAndRunWorkspace.sh <git_url>` or `./loadAndRunWorkspace.sh <git_url> "" <override>` where \<git_url\> is the URL used to clone your git repository. To use the same code that is in the config directory but load it from a git URL, use https://github.com/rberlind/basic-enterprise-backend.git.
1. If you want to specify a workspace name in your command, run `./loadAndRunWorkspace.sh <git_url> <workspace>`, `./loadAndRunWorkspace.sh "" <workspace>`, `./loadAndRunWorkspace.sh <git_url> <workspace> <override>`, or `./loadAndRunWorkspace.sh "" <workspace> <override>` where \<workspace\> is the name of the workspace.

### Running With Other Terraform Code and Variables
As mentioned above, you can replace the main.tf file in the config directory with your own Terraform code or clone Terraform code from a git repository. In the fist case, all files in the config directory will be uploaded to your TFE server.  In the second case, the entire git repository will be cloned and uploaded except for the .git directory. Edit variables.csv to remove the name variable and add rows for any Terraform and Environment variables that are required by your Terraform code.  If your code has a terraform.tfvars file, please rename it to terraform.auto.tfvars or some other file with a name matching `*.auto.tfvars` since TFE overwrites any instance of terraform.tfvars with the variables set in the workspace. Note that variables added via a `*.auto.tfvars` file will not show up on the variables tab of the workspace in the TFE UI. Additionally, you cannot add environment variables in a tfvars file. In contrast, you can add both Terraform and environment variables to the variables.csv file and they will show up on the variables tab of the workspace.

## Cleaning Up
You can run `./deleteWorkspace.sh` or `./deleteWorkspace.sh <workspace>` to delete the workspace. Be sure to set the same address, organization, and workspace variables that you set in the loadAndRunWorkspace.sh script or use the same \<workspace\> variable you used when you created the workspace with the `loadAndRunWorkspace.sh script`.
