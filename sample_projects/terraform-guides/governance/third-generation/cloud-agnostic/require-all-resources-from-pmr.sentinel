# This policy uses the tfconfig/v2 import to require that all non-root
# modules come from the Private Module Registry and that no resources
# or data sources are created in the root module.

# Import the tfconfig/v2 import, but use the alias "tfconfig"
import "tfconfig/v2" as tfconfig
# Standard strings import
import "strings"

### Parameters ###
# The address of the TFC or TFE server
param address default "app.terraform.io"
# The organization on the TFC or TFE server
param organization

# Fnd modules called from root module that are not in the desired PMR

# Print violation messages for invalid modules
