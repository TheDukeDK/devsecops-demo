# Sentinel Policies for AWS
The sample Sentinel policy files in this directory can be used with Terraform Enterprise to ensure that provisioned AWS VPCs, EC2 instances, S3 buckets, Lambda functions, and other resources comply with your organization's provisioning rules. There are also policies that restrict AMI owner IDs and the region or availability zones into which resources can be provisioned.
