# DevSecOps Demo Environment
This repository implements a demo of DevSecOps tools against some sample code bases. The goal being to evaluate these tools against each other useing the same baseline and also provide examples of usage. 

It, presently, contains the following tools to support the demo. 

* Gitlab(13.5.3-ee)
* Jenkins(2.249.3)
* SonarQube(8.4.2 Community Edition)

As much as possible, we have bootstrapped the tool stack to work together. But some **manual** configuration may be needed once the stack is running. Please see the Quick Start section for details. 

The repository includes some open source license code to use for the demo and evaluating different DevSecOps tools. See the sample_projects directory. 

## Todo's
**This demo is not yet complete!** 

Below is a list of todo's that need to be done before it is considered complete enough to be of use.

* The initial pipeline, there may come more, needs to have the stages/steps filled out and run against the sample applications. Right now it it just a mock.

* This **README** needs to be finalized and all manual configuration included.
    * Update the gitlab token in gitlab and jenkins. Maybe generate from initial-deployment script and give from command line?
    * Update the sonarqube token in jenkins.

* This repo needs to be tested on MAC and Windows.

* Need to evaluate what more needs to go into the `initial-deploy.sh` script. The purpose of this script is to bootstrap through the different tools API's what cannot be done statically in the containers.

* Add nuget to jenkins config.

* Trigger seed job from initial-deployment.sh script

## Pre-requisites
* Bash: For the bootstrap.sh script. Otherwise you can do manually.
* Curl: For the bootstrap.sh script. Otherwise you can do manually.
* Docker
* Docker Compose

A *reasonably* spec'd computer. GitLab is especially heavy to run and takes several minutes to get *healthy* on my laptop which is running Fedora and has 16GB memory and a quad core processor with 8 threads. 

If running Docker Desktop on Windows or Mac you will probably need to **tune the settings** regarding memory for the VM to prevent swapping.

Add the following to `hosts` file on the computerrunning docker. 

```
# Local stuff
127.0.0.1	traefik.local.net
127.0.0.1	sonarqube.local.net
127.0.0.1	jenkins.local.net
127.0.0.1	gitlab.local.net
```

**NOTE:** Gitlab uses Elasticsearch.

Elasticsearch uses a mmapfs directory by default to store its indices. The default operating system limits on mmap counts is likely to be too low, which may result in out of memory exceptions.

On Linux, you can increase the limits by running the following command as `root:`

```
sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
``` 

To set this value permanently, update the vm.max_map_count setting in /etc/sysctl.conf. To verify after rebooting, run sysctl vm.max_map_count.

## Quick Start

From the root of the repository.

* `docker-compose build`
* `./initial-deploy.sh`

Now you need to wait for the stack to come up.
```
Creating network "devsecops-demos_default" with the default driver
Creating volume "devsecops-demos_jenkins_data" with default driver
Creating volume "devsecops-demos_sonar_data" with default driver
Creating volume "devsecops-demos_sonar_logs" with default driver
Creating volume "devsecops-demos_sonar_db_volume" with default driver
Creating volume "devsecops-demos_gitlab_config" with default driver
Creating volume "devsecops-demos_gitlab_logs" with default driver
Creating volume "devsecops-demos_gitlab_data" with default driver
Creating gitlab       ... done
Creating jenkins      ... done
Creating traefik      ... done
Creating pg_sonarqube ... done
Creating sonarqube    ... done
Waiting for gitlab to be healthy. Be patient, may take a few minutes.
```

Once gitlab is healthy the `initial-deploy.sh` script pushes **this** repository to gitlab http://gitlab.local.net/root/devsecops-demo. 

Once **all** application are up you can run the **seed** job manually. This will generate the **pipeline** job(s) which can then be ran for demo purposes.

* http://traefik.local.net : Proxies all the applications. The Dashboard is not secured. 
* http://jenkins.local.net : Jenkins CI server. User is `jenkins` and password is `password`.
* http://gitlab.local.net : VCS repo manager. User is `root` and password is `passsword`.
* http://sonarqube.local.net : Static analysis tool. A Jenkins user is also created with the same credentials as for Jenkins itself, i.e. user is `jenkins` and password is `password`. The default user `admin` is also available with password `admin`.

## Post Bootstrap Configuration

Unfortunately we cannot full bootstrap the tools so they integrate together. The following steps must be done **after** the **first** run of the demo with the `bootstrap.sh` script and only once.

1. Update the token `token-sonarqube` in Jenkins. 

    It was generated by the bootstrap.sh script. 

    ![Generated SonarQube Token](images/sonarqube-token.png)

    Update the password with the generated token.

    ![Jenkins SonarQube Token](images/jenkins-sonarqube-token.png)

2. Create a user token for GitLab Administrator.

    After logging in to gitlab. Go to the profile->settings.

    ![Root settings](images/gitlab-token.png)

    Go to Access Tokens and generate a new user token.

    ![Generate User Token](images/gitlab-token2.png)

    **Copy** the token and update the token `gitlab-token` in Jenkins by updating the password.

    ![Jenkins Gitlab Token](images/jenkins-gitlab-token.png)

3. Allow WebHooks on local network.

    Go to Global settings->Network->Outbound Requests and make sure the settings correspond to the image below.

    ![Gitlab Network Settings](images/gitlab-network.png)

4. Create a WebHook From Gitlab To Jenkins demo Pipeline.

    First you need to create a credential in Jenkins for the Jenkins user by going to the Jenkins users profile->configure and creating one. Make sure to **copy** it.

    ![Jenkins User Token](images/jenkins-user-token.png)

    Next go to the DevSecOps-Demo repository in Gitlab and select settings->WebHooks.

    ![Create Jenkins WebHook](images/gitlab-webhook.png)

Once the above 4 steps are done the applications should be integrated together for the demo.
