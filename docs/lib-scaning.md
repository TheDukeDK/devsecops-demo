# Dependency Scanning
Scanning dependencies is critical from a security perspective. In todays world application dependency graphs are deeper than ever.

Referencing a [paper](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/203759/file-1100864196-pdf/docs/Contrast_-_Insecure_Libraries_2014.pdf) by Jeff Williams and Arshan Dabirsiaghi. 

    `Eighty percent of the code in todayâ€™s applications come from libraries and frameworks.`

This just reinforces the need to check your dependencies for security issues. 

## Technologies

The technologies covered for vulnerability scanning of dependencies presently are `.Net` and `NodJs`. The intent is to cover Java also but pipeline examples have not yet been implemented.
